Top-down 2D game for making a parody of a few online users on Discord. This is just an **unfinished** prototype that can serve as a boilerplate for any future games I make, in the similar style.

Also, it demonstrated my skills in making a game from scratch in just **one day**! The result is certainly not "shiny" but it took me about 7-8 hours to get the whole thing ready. I just spotted this [spritesheet](https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMTMxNjU5NC83NjYyNTM3LnBuZw==/original/yX5YCA.png) yesterday while Googling "spritesheet" and decided to implement it into a game! It was my first time creating a game of this accord, so... tune your expectations likewise.
